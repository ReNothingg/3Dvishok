# 🧊 Simple 3D Engine in Windows Forms (C# .NET)  

This project is a **basic 3D engine** built using **Windows Forms and C# (.NET)**. It renders a simple **3D cube** using a custom projection system and allows basic camera movement.  

## 🚀 Features  
- **3D Cube Rendering** – Displays a wireframe 3D cube using manual projection.  
- **Camera Movement** – Move the camera around the scene to view the cube from different angles.  
- **Custom 3D Projection** – Uses a simple perspective projection to simulate depth.  
- **Windows Forms UI** – Runs inside a classic WinForms application.  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used  
- **C# (.NET Framework)**  
- **Windows Forms (WinForms)**  
- **Basic 3D Math (Vectors, Matrices, Projection)**
